# HUMAN DETECTION IN SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION
This project is to develop a deep learning system that can accurately detect and locate humans in various environments to assist search and rescue teams in locating and providing aid to individuals in distress.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Drones have completely change the way of human living. Drones can cover a large area with relatively less resources compared to conventional means. They can also go places that would be difficult for traditional methods. Their ability to capture real-time images and videos aids in decision-making, enhances situational awareness, and increases response efforts, ultimately increasing the chances of saving lives during critical missions. Now combining machine learning with drones in Search and Rescue Operations(SAR) will offer a more efficient, cost-effective, and safe approach compared to traditional methods. It leverages technology to increase the chances of saving lives and enhances overall response capabilities during critical missions.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
The utilization of YOLOv8 in Search and Rescue operations proves to be promising, offering a robust solution for rapid and accurate object detection, particularly in locating individuals during critical situations. The model's real-time processing capabilities and high precision contribute to the effectiveness of SAR missions across various scenarios. However, considerations must be given to fine- tuning and customization for specific SAR environments.
